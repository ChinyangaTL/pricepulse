## Overview

### The challenge

To assess the candidate’s ability to create functional React components, integrate with an API, and apply basic UI styling in the context of a stock monitoring application.

- Create functional components for the stock list and individual stock
  items.
- Use React hooks (like useState, useEffect) for state
  management.
- Use fetch or Axios to connect to a mock API that returns stock data
- Fetch and display a list of 10 stocks upon loading the app.
- Allow users to filter the stocks by percentage change
- Use Webpack to bundle the project, as this is a requirement for our
  system
- Use SCSS instead of regular CSS for styling
- Highlight stocks with significant percentage changes
- Add functionality to sort stocks by price or percentage change
- Implement local storage to persist the user’s filter settings
